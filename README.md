# VNC for Qt/Quick on EGLFS

This project implements a [VNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing)
server for [Qt/Quick](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtquick-index.html) windows.

The basic idea of this server is to grab each frame from the GPU and to forward it
to the [RFB protocol]( https://github.com/rfbproto/rfbproto/blob/master/rfbproto.rst ).<br>
This implementation is not affected by [limitions]( https://doc.qt.io/QtQuick2DRenderer/qtquick2drenderer-limitations.html )
of the [software renderer]( https://doc.qt.io/QtQuick2DRenderer ) and allows having native OpenGL code
in application code ( custom scene graph nodes ).

As the [Qt/Quick](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtquick-index.html) technology is for
"fluid and dynamic user interfaces" the VNC server has to be able to forward
full updates ( f.e. fade in/out ) with an acceptable rate to the viewer, what
makes [image compression]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_compression) more or less mandatory.
Fortunately modern [GPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) usually offer
[encoding]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit#GPU_accelerated_video_decoding_and_encoding)
for [JPEG]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG ) and [H.264]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding ).
Encoding on the GPU also avoids the expensive calls of
[glReadPixels](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glReadPixels.xhtml) for each frame.

Obvious limitations:

- no partial updates

    A VNC server always transfers complete frames without trying to optimize for partial updates.
    Despite the fact that there is no ( at least I do not know one ) unexpensive way to identify
    the update regions it would not help much for situations like swiping, fading in/out etc.
    Of course this leads to more traffic than necessary for other situations like pressing a button.
    Using a compression like [H.264]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding ),
    that is using differences between frames, might be the best solution.

- windows instead of screens

    Usually VNC is used to mirror a complete screen/desktop with several windows
    from different applications. However the "recommended plugin for modern Embedded Linux devices"
    [EGLFS]( https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/embedded-linux.html ) only supports top level windows
    in fullscreen mode - what kind of equals windows and screens.
    For other platforms - like xcb or wayland - good solutions for mirroring a desktop are
    available.

The code might work with all Qt versions >= 5.6.

# Project Status

The current status of the implementation was tested with
remote connections to an application running on EGLFS and XCB.

Numbers depend on the capabilities of the devices and the size/content of the window,
but on my test system ( Intel i7-8559U ) I was able to display a window with 800x800 pixels
with >= 20fps remotely, when JPEG compression is enabled.
The number was found by running <em>xtigervncviewer -Log '*:stderr:100'</em> as viewer.

These features are implemented:

- mandatory parts of the RFB V3.3 protocol ( including VNC authentication )

    This similar to what is supported by the Qt VNC plugin ( + mouse wheel, additional key codes )

- [Tight/JPEG]( https://github.com/rfbproto/rfbproto/blob/master/rfbproto.rst#tight-encoding )

    Using the encoder from [Qt's image I/O system]( https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtimageformats-index.html),
    usually a wrapper for: [libjpeg-turbo]( https://libjpeg-turbo.org/ )

The following important parts are missing:

- [Authentication ( > V3.3 )]( https://github.com/rfbproto/rfbproto/blob/master/rfbproto.rst#security-types )

- [H.264 ]( https://github.com/rfbproto/rfbproto/blob/master/rfbproto.rst#open-h-264-encoding )

    Looks like support for H.264 has been [added recently]( https://github.com/TigerVNC/tigervnc/pull/1194 )
    to the [TigerVNC]( https://github.com/TigerVNC ) viewer.

- hardware video acceleration: [VA_API]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Acceleration_API )

    Without compressing the frames early on the GPU the performance of the pipeline suffers
    from expensive glReadPixels calls and what is needed to compress the image on the CPU.<br>

    and want to help: let me know.

# Installation

You can build and install the libraries/headers and the
platformproxy plugin ( see below ) using cmake. 

A typical command line sequence might be:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake <vnceglfs-dir> [-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<qt-dir>] [-DBUILD_PLATFORM_PROXY=ON]
cmake --build .
cmake --install . [--prefix <install-dir>]
```

# How to use

There are 2 way how to enable VNC support for an applation:

- [C++ API]( https://github.com/uwerat/vnc-eglfs/blob/main/src/VncNamespace.h )

    The C++ API allows to configure, start and stop a VNC servers individually.

- [VNC platform integration proxy]( https://github.com/uwerat/vnc-eglfs/blob/main/platformproxy/VncProxyPlugin.cpp )

    The VNC platform proxy allows to start VNC servers for applications that can't be modified
    or recompiled.

Both solutions are affected by the following environment variables:

- QVNC_GL_PORT

   The first unused port >= $QVNC_GL_PORT will be used when starting a server

- QVNC_GLTIMER_INTERVAL

   each server is periodically checking if a new frame is available
   and the viewer is ready to accept it. Increasing the interval might
   decrease the number of updates being displayed in the viewer.

- QVNC_GL_PASSWORD

  A string of max. 8 characters. Setting a non empty password enables
  VNC authentication.

### Application code

The most simple way to enable VNC support is to add the following line somewhere:

```
#include <VncNamespace.h>

VNC::setup();
```

If you want to get rid of the local windows you have several options:

- using the [gbm platform plugin](https://github.com/uwerat/qpagbm)
- using the undocumented "offscreen" platform, that comes with Qt ( X11 only )
- reconfiguring a [headless](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/embedded-linux.html#advanced-eglfs-kms-features) mode ( EGLFS only  )

### VNC platform integration proxy

If you do not want ( or can't ) touch application code you can load the VNC platform
plugin proxy by using one of these: [keys](https://github.com/uwerat/vnc-eglfs/blob/main/platformproxy/metadata.json).
The [proxy](https://github.com/uwerat/vnc-eglfs/blob/main/platformproxy/VncProxyPlugin.cpp)
simply does the initialization above before loading the real plugin following the "vnc" prefix.

Assuming library and plugin are installed in "/usr/local/vnceglfs":

```
# export QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH="/usr/local/vnceglfs/plugins/platforms"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/vnceglfs/lib"

export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=vnceglfs # vncxcb, vncwayland, vncoffscreen, vncgbm
```
